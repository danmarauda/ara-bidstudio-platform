## Goals & Principles

### Customisability & Extensibility

We’re explicitly trying to support the most ambitious AI-native apps of the future. To us, this means that using Cedar can’t **ever** impose any strict ceilings of what’s possible.

That’s why we **give** you the code for all components, and why we allow you to override internals in one line. By nature, components should be added to the registry and available for download, and slices should try to encapsulate responsibility as much as possible.

### Working Starter

As devs, once we have something working we can always look into the internals to trace through to understand and customise it. However, if we can’t get it to work, we don’t have anything to ground ourselves on why it’s not working.

Since we’re using a shadcn style approach where you can download components, we recommend you to always have a completed component with a working feature as part of the registry (if not downloadable, at least as an example in the docs)

## Local Development Setup

Cedar is a monorepo using Turborepo, containing the main package `(packages/cedar-os/)`, documentation `(docs/)`, components `(packages/cedar-os-components)`, and lastly a next.js app for quick and efficient testing & examples `(src/app/examples)`

1. Install dependencies

- `npm install` in the base app.
- Go to `(packages/cedar-os/)` and run `pnpm install`
- Components `(packages/cedar-os-components)` and run `npm install`

To help you setup and test changes, we recommend 2 variations:

1. **Monorepo Development**  
   Directly work in the local next.js app through `(src/app/examples)`. This will allow any changes you make in the package itself `(packages/cedar-os/)` instantly reflect in the app consuming Cedar-OS, which is useful for development speed. We do this through package.json workspaces.

   Currently we have a Cedar-Playground that we encourage you to add a section to if you're adding something, or we recommend you port your app into the base and add it to a .gitignore, which will let you test out the changes without adding unecessary examples.

   However, if you want to explicitly add an example or add to an example, feel free to do that and include it in the PR!

2. **Yalc (multi-repo) development**  
   Run 'npm run dev:yalc' in `(packages/cedar-os/)` which creates a yalc instance. Then, go to your consuming repo, and run `yalc add cedar-os`.

   This will replace the npm package node_modules in the consuming repo with the local files in `(packages/cedar-os/)`, which allows you to test your work in a consuming repo.

   The primary problem with this is that yalc compilations and propogation is fairly slow and buggy, but this allows you to change cedar-os and have it propogate to a different repo without publishing it.

3. `npm run dev` in the base next.js app

4. If you're using mastra, you also need to `npm run dev` in the mastra agent folder. For our example product-roadmap, it's `src/app/examples/product-roadmap/product_roadmap-agent`. If you're using the CLI based setup, npm run dev runs both the base next.js app and the mastra agent simultaneously.

## Adding New Features to Cedar-OS

Cedar-OS is built with a modular architecture that supports three main types of extensions. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality when adding new functionality.

1. New Slices
2. New Components
3. New processors / functions

---

### 1. Adding New Store Slices

Store slices manage application state using Zustand. They provide centralized state management for specific domains like messaging, voice, or spells.

#### Creating a New Slice

1. **Create the Slice Directory:**  
   Create a new directory under `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/` with your slice name (e.g., `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/analyticsSlice/`).

2. **Define the Slice Interface:**  
   Create your slice file (e.g., `analyticsSlice.ts`) with proper TypeScript interfaces:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice.ts
   import { StateCreator } from 'zustand';
   import type { CedarStore } from '@/store/CedarOSTypes';

   // Define the slice state interface
   export interface AnalyticsState {
     events: AnalyticsEvent[];
     isTracking: boolean;
     sessionId: string | null;
   }

   // Define the slice actions interface
   export interface AnalyticsActions {
     trackEvent: (event: AnalyticsEvent) => void;
     startTracking: () => void;
     stopTracking: () => void;
     clearEvents: () => void;
   }

   // Combine state and actions
   export type AnalyticsSlice = AnalyticsState & AnalyticsActions;

   // Create the slice
   export const createAnalyticsSlice: StateCreator<
     CedarStore,
     [],
     [],
     AnalyticsSlice
   > = (set, get) => ({
     // Initial state
     events: [],
     isTracking: false,
     sessionId: null,

     // Actions
     trackEvent: (event) => {
       const state = get();
       if (!state.isTracking) return;

       set((state) => ({
         events: [...state.events, { ...event, timestamp: Date.now() }],
       }));
     },

     startTracking: () => {
       set({
         isTracking: true,
         sessionId: `session-${Date.now()}`
       });
     },

     stopTracking: () => {
       set({ isTracking: false });
     },

     clearEvents: () => {
       set({ events: [] });
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Add Types to CedarStore:**  
   Update `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/CedarOSTypes.ts` to include your slice:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/CedarOSTypes.ts
   import { AnalyticsSlice } from '@/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice';

   export interface CedarStore
     extends StylingSlice,
       AgentContextSlice,
       StateSlice,
       MessagesSlice,
       AgentConnectionSlice,
       VoiceSlice,
       DebuggerSlice,
       SpellSlice,
       AnalyticsSlice {} // Add your slice here
   ```

4. **Integrate with Main Store:**  
   Update `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/CedarStore.ts` to include your slice:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/CedarStore.ts
   import { createAnalyticsSlice } from '@/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice';

   export const useCedarStore = create<CedarStore>()((...a) => ({
     ...createStylingSlice(...a),
     ...createAgentContextSlice(...a),
     ...createStateSlice(...a),
     ...createMessagesSlice(...a),
     ...createAgentConnectionSlice(...a),
     ...createVoiceSlice(...a),
     ...createDebuggerSlice(...a),
     ...createSpellSlice(...a),
     ...createAnalyticsSlice(...a), // Add your slice here
   }));

   // Create a convenience hook for your slice
   export const useAnalytics = () => ({
     events: useCedarStore((state) => state.events),
     isTracking: useCedarStore((state) => state.isTracking),
     sessionId: useCedarStore((state) => state.sessionId),

     trackEvent: useCedarStore((state) => state.trackEvent),
     startTracking: useCedarStore((state) => state.startTracking),
     stopTracking: useCedarStore((state) => state.stopTracking),
     clearEvents: useCedarStore((state) => state.clearEvents),
   });
   ```

5. **Export from Main Package:**  
   Add exports to `/packages/cedar-os/src/index.ts`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/index.ts
   // Export analytics slice
   export { createAnalyticsSlice } from '@/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice';
   export type { AnalyticsSlice } from '@/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice';
   export { useAnalytics } from '@/store/CedarStore';
   ```

6. **Update createCedarStore (Optional):**  
   If your slice should be included by default, add it to `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/createCedarStore.ts`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/createCedarStore.ts
   import { createAnalyticsSlice } from '@/store/analyticsSlice/analyticsSlice';

   const createDefaultSlices = (set: any, get: any, api: any) => ({
     ...createStylingSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createAgentContextSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createStateSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createAgentConnectionSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createMessagesSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createSpellSlice(set, get, api),
     ...createAnalyticsSlice(set, get, api), // Add here for default inclusion
   });
   ```

---

### 2. Adding New Components

Components are reusable React components that extend Cedar-OS's UI capabilities. They follow the shadcn-style philosophy where components can be downloaded and customized.

#### Creating a New Component

1. **Create the Component File:**  
   Create your component in the appropriate category under `/packages/cedar-os-components/`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os-components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { useAnalytics, useStyling } from 'cedar-os';
   import Container3D from '@/containers/Container3D';

   interface AnalyticsDashboardProps {
     className?: string;
     showRealTime?: boolean;
   }

   export const AnalyticsDashboard: React.FC<AnalyticsDashboardProps> = ({
     className = '',
     showRealTime = true,
   }) => {
     const { events, isTracking } = useAnalytics();
     const { styling } = useStyling();

     return (
       <Container3D className={`p-4 ${className}`}>
         <div className="space-y-4">
           <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
             <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Analytics Dashboard</h3>
             <div className={`px-2 py-1 rounded text-xs ${
               isTracking ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800'
             }`}>
               {isTracking ? 'Tracking' : 'Stopped'}
             </div>
           </div>

           <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
             <div className="p-3 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
               <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Total Events</p>
               <p className="text-xl font-bold">{events.length}</p>
             </div>
             {/* Add more analytics widgets */}
           </div>
         </div>
       </Container3D>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Export from Package Index:**  
   Add your component to `/packages/cedar-os-components/index.ts`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os-components/index.ts
   // Analytics
   export { AnalyticsDashboard } from './analytics/AnalyticsDashboard';
   ```

3. **Update Registry (for CLI support):**  
   Add your component to `/packages/cedar-os-components/registry.json`:

   ```json:/packages/cedar-os-components/registry.json
   {
     "components": [
       // ... existing components
       {
         "name": "analytics-dashboard",
         "type": "analytics",
         "dependencies": ["react"],
         "registryDependencies": ["cedar-os", "container-3d"],
         "files": ["AnalyticsDashboard.tsx"],
         "meta": {
           "importName": "AnalyticsDashboard",
           "displayName": "Analytics Dashboard",
           "description": "Real-time analytics dashboard component"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Create Index File (if new category):**  
   If creating a new component category, create an index file:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os-components/analytics/index.ts
   export { AnalyticsDashboard } from './AnalyticsDashboard';
   ```

#### Component Guidelines

- **Follow Cedar Import Rules:** Use `@/` for internal imports and `cedar-os` for Cedar OS package imports
- **Use TypeScript:** All components must be fully typed with proper interfaces
- **Include Props Interface:** Always define a clear props interface
- **Support Styling:** Integrate with Cedar's styling system using `useStyling()`
- **Handle Dark Mode:** Support both light and dark themes
- **Use Motion:** Leverage motion/react for animations when appropriate

---

### 3. Adding New Processors

Processors handle structured responses from AI agents and custom message rendering. There are two main types: Response Processors and Message Renderers.

#### Creating Response Processors

Response processors handle structured output from AI agents (e.g., actions, progress updates).

1. **Create the Processor File:**  
   Create your processor in `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/agentConnection/responseProcessors/`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/agentConnection/responseProcessors/analyticsResponseProcessor.ts
   import {
     ResponseProcessor,
     CustomStructuredResponseType
   } from '@/store/agentConnection/AgentConnectionTypes';

   // Define the response type
   export type AnalyticsResponse = CustomStructuredResponseType<
     'analytics',
     {
       eventType: string;
       data: Record<string, unknown>;
       metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
     }
   >;

   // Create the processor
   export const analyticsResponseProcessor: ResponseProcessor<AnalyticsResponse> = {
     type: 'analytics',
     namespace: 'default',
     execute: async (obj, store) => {
       // Process the analytics response
       store.trackEvent({
         type: obj.eventType,
         data: obj.data,
         metadata: obj.metadata,
         timestamp: Date.now(),
       });

       // Optionally add a message to chat
       store.addMessage({
         role: 'assistant',
         type: 'text',
         content: `Analytics event recorded: ${obj.eventType}`,
       });
     },
     validate: (obj): obj is AnalyticsResponse =>
       obj.type === 'analytics' &&
       'eventType' in obj &&
       typeof obj.eventType === 'string',
   };
   ```

2. **Register the Processor:**  
   Add to `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/agentConnection/responseProcessors/initializeResponseProcessorRegistry.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { analyticsResponseProcessor } from './analyticsResponseProcessor';

   export const defaultResponseProcessors = [
   	messageResponseProcessor,
   	actionResponseProcessor,
   	progressUpdateResponseProcessor,
   	analyticsResponseProcessor, // Add your processor
   ];
   ```

#### Creating Message Renderers

Message renderers control how different message types are displayed in the chat.

1. **Create the Renderer Component:**  
   Create your renderer in `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/messages/renderers/`:

   ```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/messages/renderers/AnalyticsRenderer.tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { CustomMessage } from '@/store/messages/MessageTypes';
   import { ShimmerText } from './ShimmerText';

   export type AnalyticsMessage = CustomMessage<
     'analytics_event',
     {
       eventType: string;
       count: number;
       data: Record<string, unknown>;
     }
   >;

   interface AnalyticsRendererProps {
     message: AnalyticsMessage;
   }

   const AnalyticsRenderer: React.FC<AnalyticsRendererProps> = ({ message }) => {
     const { eventType, count, data } = message;

     return (
       <div className="p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg">
         <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
           <ShimmerText
             text={`📊 ${eventType} (${count})`}
             state="complete"
           />
         </div>
         {Object.keys(data).length > 0 && (
           <details className="mt-2">
             <summary className="text-xs cursor-pointer">View Details</summary>
             <pre className="text-xs mt-1 overflow-x-auto">
               {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
             </pre>
           </details>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default AnalyticsRenderer;
   ```

2. **Register the Renderer:**  
   Add to `/packages/cedar-os/src/store/messages/renderers/initializeMessageRendererRegistry.tsx`:

   ```typescript
   import AnalyticsRenderer, { AnalyticsMessage } from './AnalyticsRenderer';

   export const analyticsMessageRenderer: MessageRenderer<Message> = {
   	type: 'analytics_event',
   	namespace: 'default',
   	render: (message) => (
   		<AnalyticsRenderer message={message as AnalyticsMessage} />
   	),
   	validateMessage: (msg): msg is AnalyticsMessage =>
   		msg.type === 'analytics_event',
   };

   export const defaultMessageRenderers: MessageRenderer<Message>[] = [
   	progressUpdateMessageRenderer,
   	actionResponseMessageRenderer,
   	analyticsMessageRenderer, // Add your renderer
   	...mastraEventRenderers,
   ];
   ```

#### Factory Functions

Use factory functions for reusable processor patterns:

```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/src/store/agentConnection/responseProcessors/createAnalyticsProcessor.ts
import { createResponseProcessor } from './createResponseProcessor';

export function createAnalyticsResponseProcessor(config: {
  namespace?: string;
  onEvent?: (eventType: string, data: Record<string, unknown>) => void;
}) {
  return createResponseProcessor({
    type: 'analytics',
    namespace: config.namespace || 'default',
    execute: async (obj, store) => {
      // Custom logic here
      config.onEvent?.(obj.eventType, obj.data);

      // Default behavior
      store.trackEvent({
        type: obj.eventType,
        data: obj.data,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      });
    },
    validate: (obj) => obj.type === 'analytics' && 'eventType' in obj,
  });
}
```

#### Processor Guidelines

- **Type Safety:** Always use proper TypeScript interfaces and validation
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your execute functions
- **Namespace:** Use namespaces to avoid conflicts when multiple processors handle the same type
- **Validation:** Provide validation functions to ensure type safety at runtime
- **Store Integration:** Use the provided store parameter to interact with Cedar state
- **Async Support:** Processors can be async for complex operations

#### Testing Your Processors

Create tests for your processors in `/packages/cedar-os/__tests__/`:

```typescript:/packages/cedar-os/__tests__/analyticsProcessor.test.tsx
import { analyticsResponseProcessor } from '@/store/agentConnection/responseProcessors/analyticsResponseProcessor';

describe('Analytics Response Processor', () => {
  it('should process analytics events correctly', async () => {
    const mockStore = {
      trackEvent: jest.fn(),
      addMessage: jest.fn(),
    };

    const response = {
      type: 'analytics',
      eventType: 'user_click',
      data: { button: 'submit' },
    };

    await analyticsResponseProcessor.execute(response, mockStore as any);

    expect(mockStore.trackEvent).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      type: 'user_click',
      data: { button: 'submit' },
      timestamp: expect.any(Number),
    });
  });
});
```

### Naming Conventions

Maintaining consistent naming across the codebase is critical for auto-generation, CLI support, and documentation. Follow these naming guidelines based on Cedar-OS's established patterns:

#### Store Slices

- **Slice Files:** Named as `{feature}Slice.ts` (e.g., `stylingSlice.ts`, `messagesSlice.ts`)
- **Slice Creators:** Named as `create{Feature}Slice` (e.g., `createStylingSlice`, `createMessagesSlice`)
- **Slice Types:** Named as `{Feature}Slice` interface (e.g., `StylingSlice`, `MessagesSlice`)
- **Slice Directories:** Organized as `/store/{featureName}/` (e.g., `/store/agentConnection/`, `/store/spellSlice/`)

#### Components (cedar-os-components)

- **Component Files:** Use PascalCase matching the export (e.g., `ChatInput.tsx`, `Container3D.tsx`)
- **Component Exports:** Named descriptively with Cedar prefix for main components (e.g., `CedarCaptionChat`, `FloatingCedarChat`)
- **Component Categories:** Organized by functional domain:
  - `chatComponents/` - Main chat interfaces
  - `chatInput/` - Input-related components
  - `chatMessages/` - Message display components
  - `containers/` - Layout and wrapper components
  - `spells/` - Interactive spell components
  - `text/` - Text effect components
  - `ui/` - Basic UI elements
  - `ornaments/` - Visual decoration components
  - `structural/` - Layout structure components
  - `voice/` - Voice-related components

#### Registry Naming (for CLI support)

- **Registry Names:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `cedar-caption-chat`, `container-3d-button`)
- **Import Names:** Use PascalCase matching the component export (e.g., `CedarCaptionChat`, `Container3DButton`)

### Guidelines & Best Practices

- **Code Style:** Follow the project's Biome configurations. Use meaningful variable names and small, focused functions.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose, inputs, outputs, and any special behavior for your block/tool.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and provide user-friendly error messages.
- **Parameter Visibility:** Always specify the appropriate visibility level for each parameter to ensure proper UI behavior and LLM integration.
- **Testing:** Add unit or integration tests to verify your changes when possible.
- **Commit Changes:** Update all related components and registries, and describe your changes in your pull request.

Happy coding!
